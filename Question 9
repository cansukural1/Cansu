When I started summer internship; they wanted me to learn the pega program I never heard of in a very short time. After doing the
necessary source research, I drew a road map for myself. In this direction, I tried to divide each subject into a time and finish it in
that time. Thus; learning this program showed me how to use my time easily and finish all the work. After learning about how to deal with
the difficulties I have encountered while traveling on this path, I have successfully learned the program.
